# Mastering Ethereum
## Chapter 9: Smart Contract Security (1/2)
By [Alexis](https://github.com/alexis-l8)
---

Smart contracts are public, and any user can interact with them simply by creating a transaction.
Any vulnerability can be exploited.
---

## Defensive programming
- **Minimalism/simplicity**: Complexity is the enemy of security
- **Code reuse**: Libraries, DRY principle
- **Code quality**: smart contract programming !== general-purpose programming
- **Readability/auditability**: write code that is well documented and easy to read
- **Test coverage**
---

## Security Risks and Antipatterns
1. Reentrancy
2. Arithmetic Over/Underflows
3. Unexpected Ether
4. Default Visibilities
5. Entropy Illusion
6. DELEGATECALL

---

## Reentrancy Attack
---

## Summary
1. Vulnerable SC sends ether to external Malicious SC
2. This external call is 'hijacked' by the Malicious SC's fallback function
3. External malicious contract 'reenters' by calling a function on the vulnerable contract
4. Vulnerable contract sends more ether to the Malicious SC
5. Repeat until all ether in Vulnerable contract is drained
---

## EtherStore.sol

```
contract EtherStore {

    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastWithdrawTime;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function depositFunds() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
        // limit the withdrawal
        require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);
        // limit the time allowed to withdraw
        require(now >= lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);
----->  require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;
        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;
    }
 }
```
---

## Attack.sol 1/2

```
import "EtherStore.sol";

contract Attack {
  EtherStore public etherStore;

  // intialize the etherStore variable with the contract address
  constructor(address _etherStoreAddress) {
      etherStore = EtherStore(_etherStoreAddress);
  }

  function attackEtherStore() public payable {
      // attack to the nearest ether
      require(msg.value >= 1 ether);
      // send eth to the depositFunds() function
      etherStore.depositFunds.value(1 ether)();
      // start the magic
      etherStore.withdrawFunds(1 ether);
  }

  function collectEther() public {
      msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
  }
```
---

## Attack.sol 1/2

```
  // fallback function - where the magic happens
  function () payable {
      if (etherStore.balance > 1 ether) {
          etherStore.withdrawFunds(1 ether);
      }
  }
}
```
---

## Preventative Techniques

1. Use the built in **transfer function** when sending ether to external contracts (2300 gas limit)
2. Checks-effects-interactions pattern: Ensure state changes happens before ether is sent out
3. Mutex: lock the contract during code execution
---

## EtherStore.sol - FIXED

```
contract EtherStore {
    bool reEntrancyMutex = false; // mutex
    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastWithdrawTime;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function depositFunds() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        require(!reEntrancyMutex);
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
        require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);
        require(now >= lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;
        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;
        reEntrancyMutex = true; // set reEntrancy mutex before external call
        msg.sender.transfer(_weiToWithdraw);
        reEntrancyMutex = false; // release mutex after external call
    }
 }
```

## Real World Exameple: DAO

- The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) attack was one of the major hacks that occurred in the early development of Ethereum
- At the time, the contract held over $150 million
- ultimately led to the hard fork that created Ethereum Classic (ETC)
---

## Arithmetic Over/Underflows Attack
---

## Summary
- The Ethereum Virtual Machine specifies fixed-size data types for integers
- Integer variables can represent only a certain range of numbers
- **uint8**: can only store numbers in the range [0,255]
- Fixed-size variables as being cyclic - start again from zero if we add numbers above the largest possible stored number
- Solidity can be exploited if user input is unchecked and calculations are performed that result in numbers that lie outside the range of the data type that stores them
---

## Vulnerability
- An over/underflow occurs when an operation is performed that requires a fixed-size variable to store a number (or piece of data) that is outside the range of the variable’s data type.
- Underflow: Trying to assign a number below the range of the **uint8**. 0 - 1 = 255
- Overflow: Adding numbers larger than the data type’s range. 0 + 257 = 1
---

## TimeLock.sol

```
contract TimeLock {

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    mapping(address => uint) public lockTime;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        lockTime[msg.sender] = now + 1 weeks;
    }

    function increaseLockTime(uint _secondsToIncrease) public {
        lockTime[msg.sender] += _secondsToIncrease;
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0);
        require(now > lockTime[msg.sender]);
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
        msg.sender.transfer(balance);
    }
}
```
---

## Ethernaut challenge

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Token {

  mapping(address => uint) balances;
  uint public totalSupply;

  function Token(uint _initialSupply) {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}
```
---

## Preventative Techniques
- Use or build mathematical libraries e.g. OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library
- See fixed Timelock.sol contract with SafeMath Library [here](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/09smart-contracts-security.asciidoc#preventative-techniques-1)
---

# Real World Example: PoWHC
- Proof of Weak Hands Coin (PoWHC) - lost 866 ether
---

## Unexpected Ether Attack
---

## Summary
- Avoid using this.balance in your contracts as this can be forcibly manipulated
---

## Vulnerability
- There are two ways in which ether can (forcibly) be sent to a contract without using a payable function or executing any code on the contract
1. **Self-destruct/suicide**
  - Any attacker can create a contract with a selfdestruct function, send ether to it, call selfdestruct(target) and force ether to be sent to a target contract.
2. **Pre-sent ether**
  - Contract addresses are deterministic.
  - This means anyone can calculate what a contract’s address will be before it is created and send ether to that address. When the contract is created it will have a nonzero ether balance.
---

# [EtherGame.sol](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/09smart-contracts-security.asciidoc#unexpected-ether)
## Example 5
---

## Preventative Techniques
- Avoid using this.balance
- If exact values of deposited ether are required, a self-defined variable should be used that is incremented in payable functions, to safely track the deposited ether. This variable will not be influenced by the forced ether sent via a selfdestruct call.
---

# [EtherGame.sol FIXED](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/09smart-contracts-security.asciidoc#unexpected-ether)
## Example in Preventative Techniques
---

# Default Visibilities Attack
---

## Summary

- Functions in Solidity have visibility specifiers that dictate how they can be called - external, public, internal or private
- Functions default to public, allowing users to call them externally!
- Issue arises when developers omit visibility specifiers on functions that should be private.
---

## Vulnerability

```
contract HashForEther {

    function withdrawWinnings() {
        // Winner if the last 8 hex characters of the address are 0
        require(uint32(msg.sender) == 0);
        _sendWinnings();
     }

     function _sendWinnings() { <-- PUBLIC BY DEFAULT
         msg.sender.transfer(this.balance);
     }
}
```
---

## Preventative Techniques

- Always specify the visibility of all functions in a contract, even if they are intentionally public.
---
## Real-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (First Hack)

- In the first Parity multisig hack, about $31M worth of Ether was stolen.
---

## Entropy Illusion Attack
---

## Summary
- All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are deterministic state transition operations.
- Therefore there is no source of entropy or randomness in Ethereum.
---

## Vulnerability

- Randomness must come from a source external to the blockchain.
- Common pitfall is to use future block variables ie variables containing information about the transaction block whose values are not yet known: hashes, timestamps, block numbers, or gas limits
- BUT these are controlled by the miner who mines the block, and as such are not truly random
---

## Attack Example

A roulette smart contract with logic that returns a black number if the next block hash ends in an even number. A miner (or miner pool) could bet $1M on black. If they solve the next block and find the hash ends in an odd number, they could happily not publish their block and mine another, until they find a solution with the block hash being an even number (assuming the block reward and fees are less than $1M).
---

## Preventative Techniques

- Do not use block variables as a source for entropy.
- You could use a centralized entity that acts as a randomness oracle.
- RANDAO contract - changing the trust model to a group of participants.
---

# Real-World Example: PRNG Contracts

- PRNG = pseudorandom number generator.
- An analysis in Feb 2018 found 43/3649 live contracts were vulnerable.
---

# DELEGATECALL ATTACK
---

## Summary

- External message calls to contracts are handled by opodes. Useful for modularizing code.
- This feature enables the implementation of libraries, allowing developers to deploy reusable code once and call it from future contracts.
- `CALL`: code is run in the context of the external contract/function.
- `DELEGATECALL`: code executed at the targeted address is run in the context of the calling contract.
- `DELEGATECALL` can lead to unexpected code execution.
---

## Vulnerability

- Code in libraries themselves can be secure and vulnerability-free.
- But run in the context of another application new vulnerabilities can arise.
- State or storage variables (variables that persist over individual transactions) are placed into slots sequentially as they are introduced in the contract.
- Library contract: first variable, start, is stored in the contract’s storage at slot[0] (i.e., the first slot). The second variable, calculatedFibNumber, is placed in the next available storage slot, slot[1].
---

## Preventative Techniques

- Solidity provides the library keyword for implementing library contracts
- When using DELEGATECALL pay careful attention to the possible calling context of both the library contract and the calling contract
---

## Real-World Example: Parity Multisig Wallet (Second Hack)

- The Second Parity Multisig Wallet hack is an example of how well-written library code can be exploited if run outside its intended context.
