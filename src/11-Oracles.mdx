# **Oracles**

**CHAPTER 11**  
**MASTERING ETHEREUM**  



*21 Jan 2019*
---

Oracles bridge the gap between the digital _***smart contract/on-chain***_ world and the _***real/off-chain***_ world
---

# Example Weather Smart Contract

1. If it is sunny tomorrow, you win 1 ether.
2. But if it is rainy tomorrow, you lose 1 ether.

So how do we let the smart contract know it if rains or shines?
---

You guessed it, Oracles ü§ì
---

In Greek mythology, an Oracle is a person in communication with the gods who can see visions of the future.
---

### Why are Oracles needed?
---

The Ethereum Virtual Machine executes programs and updates the state of Ethereum.  
EVM execution is totally deterministic, based only on the shared Ethereum state and signed transactions.
---

This introduces 2 problems:  

1. There can be no intrinsic source of randomness --> otherwise no network consensus on what the state should be  
2. Extrinsic data can only be introduced as the data payload of a transaction -->  signed transactions (extrinsic information) may not be trustworthy  

Oracles solves these problems...
---

### Oracle use cases and examples

- Triggers relating to natural hazards e.g. Richter scale measurements for an earthquake bond
- Political events: for prediction market resolution
- Sporting events: for prediction market resolution and fantasy sports contracts
- Damage verification: for insurance contracts
- Events occurring on other blockchains: interoperability functions
- Etc...
---

## Oracles are ideally trustless
---

However, some oracles provide data from a private source e.g. academic certificates, government IDs.  

In these cases:
- The source of the data is fully trusted e.g. university, governement department
- But the truth of the data is subjective e.g. did I really finish university or actually just bribe them  

Such data cannot be provided trustlessly, yet we still consider them Oracles since they provide a data bridge for smart contracts.
---

## Oracle Key Functions

1. Collect data from an off-chain source.
2. Transfer the data on-chain with a signed message.
3. Make the data available by putting it in a smart contract‚Äôs storage.

Once the data is available in a smart contract‚Äôs storage, it can be accessed by other smart contracts, Ethereum nodes or network-enabled clients.
---

## Oracle Design Patterns  
3 main ways to set up an Oracle

1. Immediate-Read
2. Publish-Subscribe
3. Request‚ÄìResponse
---

## Immediate-Read Oracle

- These provide data when it is needed on a "just-in-time" basis.
- The oracle stores the data in its contract storage, so other smart contracts can get it with a request call.
- The data is also available for direct lookup. (no gas costs or issuing a transaction)
---

## Immediate-Read Oracle

- This type of oracle is attractive to an organization or company that might otherwise have to run and maintain servers to answer such data requests.
- Note that the data stored by the oracle is likely not to be the raw data that the oracle is serving, e.g., for efficiency or privacy reasons.
- Hashes of the raw data might be stored instead. E.g. private identification data --> hash

Example: A shop wanting to check the age of a customer wishing to purchase alcohol could use an oracle in this way.
---

## Publish‚ÄìSubscribe

- The Oracle provides a broadcast service for data that is expected to change. (Similar to RSS Feed)
- When updated with new information, a flag signals that new data is available to those who consider themselves "subscribed".
- Interested parties either poll the oracle to check whether the latest information has changed, or listen for updates to oracle contracts and act when they occur.
---

## Publish‚ÄìSubscribe

- Polling is very inefficient in the world of web servers, but not so with Ethereum.
- Ethereum clients have to keep up with all state changes, including changes to contract storage, so polling for data changes is a local call to a synced client.
- However, if the polling is done from a smart contract, then significant gas expenditure may be incurred.
---

## Request-Response

- The pattern is used when the amount of data is too large to be stored in a smart contract and users are expected to only need a small part of the overall dataset at a time. e.g. Bloomberg
- In practical terms, such an oracle might be implemented as a system of on-chain smart contracts and off-chain infrastructure used to monitor requests and retrieve and return data.
- The request and response could be made to and from an Internet of Things‚Äìenabled hardware sensor.
- Therefore, oracles can be human, software, or hardware.
---

## Request-Response Steps

1. Receive a query from a DApp.
2. Parse the query.
3. Check that payment and data access permissions are provided.
4. Retrieve relevant data from an off-chain source (and encrypt it if necessary).
5. Sign the transaction(s) with the data included.
6. Broadcast the transaction(s) to the network.
7. Schedule any further necessary transactions, such as notifications, etc.
---

## Data Authentication

- Data may be tampered with in transit.
- It is critical that off-chain methods are able to attest to the returned data‚Äôs integrity.

Two common approaches to data authentication:  

1. Authenticity proofs  
2. Trusted execution environments (TEEs)
---

## Authenticity Proofs

- These are cryptographic guarantees that data has not been tampered with.
- By verifying the authenticity proof on-chain, smart contracts are able to verify the integrity of the data before operating upon it.
---

## Trusted Execution Environments

- A TEE is a secure area inside a main processor.
- It runs in parallel of the operating system, in an isolated environment.
- It guarantees that the code and data loaded in the TEE are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.
---

## Computation Oracles

- Ethereum has a block gas limit and expensive computation costs.
- Computation oracles can be used to perform computation on a set of inputs and return a calculated result that may have been infeasible to calculate on-chain.

Examples:

1. Oraclize - centralized but auditable service
2. TrueBit - more decentralized solution
---

Centralized data or computation oracles suffice for many applications, but they represent single points of failure in the Ethereum network.
---

## Decentralized Oracles
*Example: ChainLink*

A decentralized oracle network consisting of:
- 3 key smart contracts (a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregation contract)
- An off-chain registry of data providers.
---

## ChainLink

- Reputation Contract: keep track of data providers' performance
- Order-Matching Contract: selects bids from oracles using the reputation contract
- Aggregation Contract: collects responses from multiple oracles and calculates the final collective result
---

## ChainLink Problems*

- ChainLink proposes calculating a weighted response, allowing a validity score to be reported for each oracle response.
- It relies on the premise that outlying data points, measured by deviations from responses provided by peers, are incorrect.
- This risks penalizing correct answers over average ones.

*ChainLink offers a standard set of aggregation contracts, but also allows customized aggregation contracts to be specified.

### Words of Week

### Schelling Point  

- In game theory, a focal point (also called Schelling point) is a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them.
- Introduced by the Nobel Memorial Prize-winning American economist Thomas Schelling.

From his book *The Strategy of Conflict* :  
"...focal point for each person's expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do".
---

## SchellingCoin protocol
- Multiple participants report values and the median is taken as the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer.
- Reporters are required to provide a deposit that is redistributed in favor of values that are closer to the median.
- This incentivizes the reporting of values that are similar to others.
- The Schelling point is expected to be close to the actual value.
---

## Conclusion

- Oracles provide a crucial service to smart contracts, bringing external facts to contract execution.
- When considering the use of an oracle be very careful about the trust model.
---

"Choose carefully and you can start exploring the bridge between Ethereum and the "real world" that oracles offer."
